## About this project

This is a Rubik's cube timer app that is meant to time the user when solving and display
their times in various ways. There are buttons at the bottom to navigate between pages.
The first page is the home page, which will have the scrambles and the timer. The second
page has a list of all times, with a popup for each time that gives more details about it.
The third page has a graph that shows how fast the user is over time.
